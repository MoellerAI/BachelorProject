# BachelorProject
This repository contains my final code for my bachelor project. The scope of the project is to illustrate the use of LSTM for time series prediction. 
I have created an algorithmic trading bot using my LSTM model. This repository doesn't include my hyperparameter tuning of the model.
The purpose of this repository is only to be able to share the code.
For this project i have been using Keras, though i afterwards has converted to PyTorch.
